# 🎮 Arcade Project

Welcome to the **Arcade Project**!  
This repository contains all of my personal arcade-style games and is designed as a place to **develop, organize, and share** small games and simulators.  
It also serves as a practice ground for **Game Design** , **GDScript (Godot Engine)** and **Unity Engine**.

You can also find documents about the actual arcade machine I'm building with a **Raspberry Pi** !

2. Open the desired game folder in Godot Engine.
3. Run the project and start playing.

⚠️ Notes

ROMs: To avoid copyright issues, ROM files are kept in private folders and are not shared in this repository.

Git workflow: For each new feature or game, create a separate branch:
```bash 
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-game
```

## 📌 Project Goals

1. Collect and develop personal arcade games.
2. Practice game development workflows
3. Create an organized environment for managing, testing, and sharing projects.
4. Build a professional portfolio of games.

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- Add more games (platformers, shooters, puzzle games).
- Improve documentation and add design notes for each game.
- Explore multiplayer or online arcade-style games.
- Share finished builds for public testing.
