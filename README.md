# 🎮 Arcade Project

Welcome to the **Arcade Project**!  
This repository contains all of my personal arcade-style games and is designed as a place to **develop, organize, and share** small games and simulators.  
It also serves as a practice ground for **Game Design** and **GDScript (Godot Engine)**.

## 🚀 Getting Started


1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Arcade.git
   
2. Open the desired game folder in Godot Engine.
3. Run the project and start playing.

⚠️ Notes

ROMs: To avoid copyright issues, ROM files are kept in private folders and are not shared in this repository.

Git workflow: For each new feature or game, create a separate branch:
```bash 
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-game
